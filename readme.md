# My solar panels

My Solar Panels is a simple webapp, built with React and scaffolded with Yeoman. This is the generator being used https://github.com/stylesuxx/generator-react-webpack-redux (visit the page for more information on how to get started)

## Getting started with your solution
1. Fork this repository (you might have to turn off Atlassian's "new nav" as it's buggy with Forking right now) to your own, new, **private** (important) repository
1. Start working on your solution
1. Once finished, invite mikael@greenbyte.com to your private repository
1. Send an email to mikael@greenbyte.com and let us know you are done

## The goal
Solve as many tasks as you can. We want to see small, focused commits that describe your changes.

### Task 1
The solar panel with id "2" is troublesome and needs repairs. The house owner wants to move it to the bottom row so it's more accessible. Swap panel 2 and 8.

### Task 2
Our designer has decided we want to offer two different roof colours, instead of the currently hard-coded grey roof. The two available colours should be grey (current style) and terracotta (new style).

### Task 3
The solar panels are hard-coded to a capacity of 250W, but we want to support different types of panels so the capacity needs to be configurable. It's good enough if the capacity is defined when ID and roof position is set.

### Task 4
We want to add a button that stops/starts all solar panels. It should be a new react component, please scaffold using Yeoman. The button can be placed anywhere on the house.

### Task 5
During the latest release, the title "My solar panels" got left-aligned by mistake. It should be centered across the sky. This needs correcting, there is a clue in the git history.

### Task 6
Our product owner wants the measured electrical production for each panel to be rendered in red when it is below 20% of the panel's maximum capacity.
